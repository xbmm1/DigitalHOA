# Guidelines for Project 1

This document contains guidelines, requirements, and suggestions for Project 1.

## Team Effort

Before anything, remember that projects are a group effort: Working closely with your teammates is a requirement. This helps teach real-world collaborative workflows and enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone.

In other words, working in groups allows you to **work smart** and **dream big**. Take advantage of it!

## Project Proposal

Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data.

* Possible source for such data.
The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

* [ ] Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process.

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**.

* [ ] Use Hvplot or GeoViews to create six to eight data visualizations (ideally, at least two per question asked of the data).

* [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.

* [ ] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.

* [ ] Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each question you asked of your data and under each heading a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
